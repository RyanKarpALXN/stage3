Introduction

STaGE is a tool for generating GROMACS topology files for generic small molecules
(organic molecules) in different force fields and a selection of charge models.
Force fields and charge models use a plugin system, making it easy to add more
alternatives. STaGE uses a number of different programs to generate topologies, see
:doc:`dependencies` for more information. STaGE is released under GNU LGPL V3.0 and
may be released under a later version of the LGPL.
